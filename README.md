The goal of this project is to reproduce a simplified version of the classic board game Scrabble. During the first milestone, the project should implement a text-based playable version of the game where player can
use the keyboard to input their input on the console during each turn. Each player should be able to view their drawn letters, place words following the rules, pass their turn, and view the updated game board in
text form. The deliverables includes the code, UML diagrams, and documentations.
